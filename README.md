This project is my personal portfolio site as a full stack developer.

The aim of the design was to playfully mimic a typical IDE/text editor, with a light colour scheme and focus on presenting projects.

The design includes social icons from FontAwesome which are licensed under Creative Commons. The FontAwesome license can be found at https://fontawesome.com/license/free. All brand icons are trademarks of their respective owners.
